MobileTwitterrific is a native iPhone application for using Twitter.

I also hope it acts as a "best practices" document for developing native applications on the iPhone using the toolchain created at the iPhone Dev Wiki.

Screenshots will be posted once we have something that we want to show off.

If you want to build a copy for yourself, please take a look at the README file. It has a comprehensive set of instructions for setting up a toolchain and building the application.
