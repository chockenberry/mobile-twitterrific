Introduction
------------

This project is used to create a native iPhone application for using Twitter.

It's secondary purpose is to act as a "best practices" document for creating
native iPhone applications.

Environment
-----------

It is assumed that your "heavenly" frameworks are in /Developer/SDKs/heavenly
and that your SDK headers are in /Developer/SDKs/iPhone.

You'll also need to make sure that you have the ARM compilation tools in
/Developer/SDKs/iPhone/bin (arm-apple-darwin-cc and arm-apple-darwin-ld). I
used Kroo's toolchain installer (v0.4) from here:

<http://ellkro.jot.com/WikiHome/ToolchainInstallation>

Get the latest header files with:

% sudo svn checkout \
	http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/iphone-binutils/trunk/include \
	/Developer/SDKs/iPhone/include

Then symlink CoreGraphics:

% sudo ln -s \
	/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Headers/ \
	/Developer/SDKs/iPhone/include/CoreGraphics

If you have problems compiling, make sure that you have include/WebCore and
that include/CarbonCore has headers (and not .diff files.) Finally, you may
need to comment out some #include "NSObject.h" in Celestial and WebCore.

Building
--------

Open the MobileTwitterrificApp.xcodeproj and build. The project is built using
the Makefile in the project's root directory.

If you add files to the project, you need to update the SOURCES in the
the Makefile. They will not automatically be added to the build. Until there
is better Xcode integration with the iPhone toolchain, that's the way it
has to be.

Note also that there aren't any precompiled headers and there is isn't any
code index. So builds will get slower as the project size increases and you'll
be sorely disappointed by what you see when you hit the ESC key while editing
(no code completion.)

After the build completes, you'll find the iPhone application package in
the build/Release folder. The final build step uses scp to get the application
onto the iPhone in the /Applications folder: you'll need to update the command
in the Makefile to suit your local environment.

Debugging
---------

NSLog. Learn to love it, since printf is all you have at the moment.

otool can also be handy for what's in the executable.
