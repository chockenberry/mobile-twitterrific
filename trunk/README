MobileTwitterrific.app
======================

Introduction
------------

This project is used to create a native iPhone application for using Twitter.

It's secondary purpose is to act as a "best practices" document for creating
native iPhone applications.

Building
--------

Open the MobileTwitterrificApp.xcodeproj and build. The project is built using
the Makefile in the project's root directory.

If you add files to the project, you need to update the SOURCES in the
the Makefile. They will not automatically be added to the build. Until there
is better Xcode integration with the iPhone toolchain, that's the way it
has to be.

Note also that there aren't any precompiled headers and there is isn't any
code index (so no code completion.)
